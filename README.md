Our DSAI Mini-Project focuses on developing an elaborate recommendation system for Disney+ movies based on a content-based filtering mechanism. Considering a variety of different characteristics provided in the dataset, we're going to recommend a list of the most similar movies available on the platform after the user has watched a particular film.
